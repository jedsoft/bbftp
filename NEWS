Version 3.3.0

  bbftpd: (server)

   New command line options:

    -A
      When started via ssh and the client is running behind a
      firewall, the server will be unable to get the IP address of the
      client.  This option tells the server to ask the client for its
      IP address.  The bbftp client has been modified to support this
      feature.  This is useful when the server is behind a firewall
      and can connect to the client, but the client cannot connect to
      the server.  In this mode, the bbftp-client `-D' option should
      be used to specify protocol version 2 (non-passive).

    -h
      Print a usage message

    -L logfile
      This command line option may be used to write server logs to the
      specified file instead of syslog.  This is particularly useful
      when invoked via ssh.

  bbftp (client)

     Added support for telling the server the client's IP address when
     requested.

  bbftp-get

     This is an slsh script that allows bbftp to be used in a similar
     way as scp
