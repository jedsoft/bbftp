NOTE: Bbftp uses the crypto library, which is not included here and
must be install before bbftp can be compiled.  Debian users should
install the libssl-dev package to get this library:

   apt-get install libssl-dev

To build and install software, run the following commands:

   make config
   make build
   make install

By default, it will be installed under /usr/local.  To configure the
software with a different prefix, or other configuration options, use
a variation of

   make CONFIGOPTS="--prefix=/usr/local" config

If you have slsh installed, the software can be tested prior to
the installation.  Before running the test, first make sure that you
can login to localhost by running

  ssh localhost

After sucessfully logging into localhost, log out, then run the test:

   make check

Note: This test requires at least 3GB of space in /tmp
