To build and install software, run the following commands:

   make config
   make build
   make install

By default, it will be installed under /usr/local.  To configure the
software with a different prefix, or other configuration options, use
a variation of

   make CONFIGOPTS="--prefix=/usr/local" config

If you have slsh installed, the software can be tested prior to
installing by running

   make check
