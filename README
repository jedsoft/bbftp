The code here is based upon version 3.2.1 of the bbftp software that
was downloaded from <http://software.in2p3.fr/bbftp/>.  The original
software was written by Gilles Farrache at IN2P3 and released under
the GNU General Public License.

Version 3.2.1 was released in early 2013.  As such, it will no longer
compile with recent versions of the OpenSSL library.  I made the
necessary modifications to version 3.2.1 of bbftp client to enable it
to work with OpenSSL 1.1.0.  I made several attempts to contact the
authors at bbftp@in2p3.fr with my patches.  So far I received no
responses.

I testing the code with valgrind and discovered a number of leaks and
various access errors.  In the process of correcting these, I made
many other changes to the code in an effort to clean it up to compile
without warnings with my standard set of compiler flags.  As a result,
the current version of the code here is very different from the
original source code.

The test code is in the tests subdirectory.  In order to use it, you
will need to have slsh installed.  See <https://jedsoft.org/slang/>.
