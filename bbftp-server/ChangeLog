                 only). See BBFTPD man page.
               o Add option -g in the client command line to specify a Globus

                 it uses /tmp instead of sending an error

               o Use AFS password request when built with AFS
               o Remove RFIO temporary file only once in case of multi-stream
                 transfer failure
          + Licence
               o Add COPYING file

          + Corrects  problems  on the Linux version due to malign-double
            compilation parameter (severe)

          + Adapt client and daemon to CASTOR (RFIO at CERN)
     * 2.0.1
          + Correct the frequent "Interrupted system call" on the bbftpd daemon
            (patch01 and patch03 of 2.0.0)

          + Automaticly add "-s" option inside the "bbftpd command line" for -E
            option (to conform to version 1.9.4-tja1)
     * 2.0.0
          + Warning Release 2.0.0 is a major release, and the changes in the
            protocol between the client and the server lead to the following
            situation :
               o bbftpd server works with bbftp clients in version 2.0.0 and
                 1.x.x
               o bbftpc and bbftpcd are not provided in release 2.0.0
               o bbftp client in version 2.0.0 works only with bbftpd server
                 version 2.0.0
               o Default control port has been changed from 4021 to 5021. 
          + New authentication method using ssh (Tim Adye idea)
          + No more limitation on file name
          + No more limitation on stream number
          + New features on client command line
               o -L "ssh command"
               o -E "bbftpd command line"
               o -s for ssh mode
               o -S for ssh mode in batch (always not asking for a password)
               o -W for warning on stderr
               o -V for verbose mode (the old standart mode with the >> )
               o -e "control command ; control command" (several commands may
                 be entered separated by ;)
               o -F "bbftprc file" (explained later)
          + New features on server command line
               o -v to print version number and default on stdout
               o -f not to use a fixed date port
               o -s to run started by ssh
          + New control commands
               o setbuffersize %d : define the read (and write) buffer size in
                 Kbytes for each stream
               o setlocalcos %d : Define the local COS (RFIO only)
               o setremotecos %d : Define the remote COS (RFIO only)
               o setlocalumask %o : Define the local umask (default is the
                 process umask)
               o setremoteumask %o : Define the remote umask (default 022)
               o setsendwinsize %d : Define the send window size (in Kbytes) on
                 each stream for the server (in this case the receive window of
                 the client is set to this value)
               o setrecvwinsize %d : Define the receive window size (in Kbytes)
                 on each stream for the server (in this case the send window of
                 the client is set to this value)
               o setnbstream %d : You can override the -p option with that
                 command (all further commands are going to use this number of
                 streams)
               o setoption [ [no]createdir | [no]tmpfile | [no]remoterfio |
                 [no]localrfio | [no]keepmode |[no]keepaccess | [no]gzip ]
                    # creatdir  : automatic directory creation (default :
                      creatdir)
                    # tmpfile : always use a temporary file name (default :
                      tmpfile)
                    # remoterfio : set the server in rfio mode (default :
                      noremoterfio)
                    # localrfio  : set the client in rfio mode (default :
                      nolocalrfio)
                    # keepmode : keep file mode (default : keepmode)
                    # keepaccess  :  keep last access and last modif time
                      (default : keepaccess)
                    # gzip : compress on the flight (defaul : nogzip except if
                      -c flag was used on command line)
          + New behaviour
               o If  the  option  tmpfile  is used then if the new file (
                 RemoteFile for a put or LocalFile for a get) did not exist
                 before, bbftp ensures that the file transfer was correct if
                 the file exists
               o In case of an already existing file, if the size, the last
                 access and modification time are correct (if option keepaccess
                 has been set) bbftp ensures that the file transfer was correct
               o After a successful connection to the daemon the client is
                 going  to  execute  all  control commands located in the
                 $HOME/.bbftprc file. The location of this file can be changed
                 with option -F.
          + bbftp is now able to work on both side with RFIO, as RFIO is able
            to work with HPSS it is now
     * 1.9.4
          + Add -b options in bbftpd. This option allows a daemon compiled with
            DAEMONMODE equal a zero to be run in background.
          + Add -w options in bbftpd. This option tells bbftpd to listen on a
            different  port. (Useful for debugging purposes or if several
            deamons have to run under several uid). This option cannot be used
            if running under inetd.
          + Add -w options in bbftp and bbftpcd. This option allows to connect
            to a bbftpd daemon listening a different port than the default.
          + Add a FIXEDDATAPORT in config.h parameter in order to tell bbftpd
            to use CONTROLPORT-1 localport for data socket.
          + Back to socket in blocking mode because Sun and Linux have a non
            documented behaviour if no network buffers are available.
          + Compilation and Installation guide changed.
     * 1.9.1
          + Correct a bug in PAM authentication in bbftpd.
          + Change the command putrfio in rfioput (if RFIO is supported).
          + Add the command rfioget (if RFIO is supported).
          + Add the command setlocalcos (if RFIO is supported).
          + Add -l option on bbftp and bbftpc clients to define the COS (mainly
            for use in bbftpc -e) (if RFIO is supported)
          + Add -o option on bbftpcd in order to keep the bbftpcd pid in a file
          + Change the output of all -v option in order to know if the client
            has been compiled with RFIO
          + Support for HP-UX 10.20
     * 1.9.0
          + Add putrfio command in all clients (if RFIO is supported).
          + Add support for PAM authentication.
          + Add support for shadow password in authentication.
          + Use of the autoconf utilitie in order to help port for clients and
            daemon.
          + Support for AIX 4.3
          + Ability to stop clients via Ctrl^C or via SIGTERM
          + Add -r option on client to define the number of tries
          + Manual pages in html format
