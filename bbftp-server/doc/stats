    Collecting transfer data

   Transfer information are logged in the system log with the facility daemon
   and level notice if and only if the server is launched with a trace level
   greater than notice:
   % bbftpd -b -lNOTICE
   The output format is:
   action user filename bytes_transfered seconds kbytes/s Mbits/s
   action is GET or PUT.

    Building statistics

   Nothing is provided with BBFTP to build statistics with the data
   collected. You should use a third party tool run on a periodical basis.
