    Zlib

   This software allows BBFTP to compress/uncompress data on-the-fly.
   It can be downloaded at [1]http://www.gzip.org/zlib. The recommended
   version is 1.1.4 which fixes a potential security problem.
   This library is optional for both client and server.
   The default behavior of the BBFTP build process is to search Zlib
   automatically.

    OpenSSL

   This software allows BBFTP to encrypt user connection details (user name +
   password) when using the standard authentication method.
   It can be downloaded at [2]http://www.openssl.org.
   This library is optional for BBFTP client. It is mandatory for BBFTP
   server except in certificates mode (The Globus Toolkit includes it).
   The default behavior of the BBFTP build process is to search OpenSSL
   automatically.

    Globus Toolkit 2

   This software allows BBFTP to use certificates as authentication mode. The
   recommended version is Globus Toolkit 2.4.3. It is divided into several
   components. The one needed by BBFTP is GSI (Grid Security Infrastructure)
   Bundle. It can be downloaded at
   [3]http://www-fp.globus.org/gt2.4/download.html or directly
   [4]http://www-unix.globus.org/ftppub/gt2/2.4/2.4-latest/bundles/src/globus-gsi-2.4.3-src_bundle.tar.gz.
   Security updates must be installed as well (download at:
   [5]http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/advisories.html?version=2.4
   Theses libraries are mandatory when using certificates.
   If BBFTP is built in certificate mode, the default behavior of the build
   process is to search GSI automatically, else GSI is not included in the
   build process.

    AFS

   BBFTP is interfaced with AFS so that password entered in standard
   authentication mode is handled by AFS.
   By default, AFS is not included in the build process.

    RFIO

   This software allows BBFTP to access files directly from the hierarchical
   storage systems HPSS or Castor.
   RFIO64 is also supported.
   The default behavior of the BBFTP build process is to search RFIO
   automatically.
