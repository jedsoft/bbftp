    External software required (on both client and server hosts)

     * GSI (Grid Security Infrastructure) from the Globus 2 Toolkit (2.0 or
       2.2)

   Refer to the [1]Working with external software section.

    System requirements

     * The certificate mode has been tested for Linux intel and Solaris only

    Certificates

   2 certificates needed:

     * A host certificate or a user certificate on the BBFTP server host.
     * A user certificate on the BBFTP client host.

    Build process

   For both client and server, use the --enable-authentication=certificates
   option for the configure script.
   See the installation sections for [2]the client and for [3]the server.

    Running the BBFTPD daemon

   Before starting the daemon, some environment variables can be set to
   override default values for certificates paths, mapfile location... If you
   use the --with-x509... options of the configure script, these variables
   will be automatically set.
   Refer to [4]the Globus documentation for more details.

   Run the daemon "bbftpd -b"

   If you use a host certificate, you must be root to start the daemon. The
   CN field of the certificate must be the full name of the host (i.e.
   host.domain). If it is something else (for example a service name), it
   must be specified by the client with the -g option.
   If you want to start your own daemon, you must use another certificate (a
   host certificate you can read or your own certificate). In this case, only
   you can use the bbftp client against this server, and you will have to use
   the -g option (see BBFTP Client man page).

    Running the client

   Before running the client, you must create a temporary proxy using the
   grid-proxy-init command.

   Run the client "bbftp -e<command_list>|-i<control_file> <remote_host>"
   Please, note that the -u option is not used in the certificate
   authentication mode. If you use it, BBFTP will use the standard
   authentication mode.
