BBFTP
-----
    * What BBFTP is

        o BBFTP is a software designed to quickly transfer files accross a
          wide area network. It has been written for the Babar experiment in
          order to transfer big files (more than 2 GigaBytes) between SLAC
          (Californie) and the In2p3 Computing Center(Lyon,France).

        o BBFTP is divided in two parts : a daemon and several clients. The
          clients are talking with the daemon on a control connection, and
          are transfering data throught several parallel tcp streams. All
          those streams use big windows as defined in rfc1323.

        o BBFTP also give the ability to compress (and uncompress) data on
          the fly. Usage has shown that with a speed link of 34 Mbps,
          compression, even with a powerfull computer is not efficient.

        o In order to secure the transmission of the username and the
          password BBFTP uses the cryptolib of the OpenSSL project.

   * What BBFTP is not

        o A client implementing the FTP protocol.

        o A very efficient tool to transfer small files accross a local area
          network.
